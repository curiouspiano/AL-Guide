# Overview
With the freedom AL provides, players are able to create their own clients, if they so wish.

## [ALClient](https://github.com/earthiverse/ALClient)

## [ALBot](https://github.com/NexusNull/ALBot)
ALClient is a node client written in Typescript. Because it works much differently than the official client, code cannot be reused like it can with other 3rd party node clients. It features custom pathfinding, and optional MongoDB integration. It runs efficiently enough to play 4 characters off a low powered computer like a Raspberry Pi or a low-end VPS.
