# AL-Guide

## Disclaimer

This repo will be a guide from the perspective of a player. It will include things that are nice to know when starting to play AdventureLand, as well as some some useful code snippets.

This guide is not intended to be a walkthrough. A big part of AL is finding *your* way through the game. The primary goal of this guide is to document things that we, as players, think is good information for new players to know.

This repo **WILL NOT** include a client, or standalone code to run your characters.
